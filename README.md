# Virtual Try-On Clothing Mirror

This project demonstrates a virtual try-on system using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. The system allows users to try on virtual clothing items on their captured images, simulating the experience of trying on clothes without physically wearing them.

## Overview

The virtual try-on system consists of several components:

- **Main Script:** `main_script.py` - Orchestrates the entire try-on process by calling functions for body detection, clothing segmentation, and overlay techniques.

- **Body Detection Module:** `body_detection.py` - Handles body detection and segmentation using OpenCV or other computer vision techniques.

- **Clothing Segmentation Module:** `clothing_segmentation.py` - Manages TensorFlow model loading, image preprocessing, and clothing segmentation.

- **Overlay Techniques Module:** `overlay_techniques.py` - Contains functions for overlaying segmented clothing onto the detected body region using image processing techniques.

- **Pretrained Model Files:** Stored in the `pretrained_models/` directory, including pre-trained models for body detection (`body_detection_model.h5`), clothing segmentation (`clothing_segmentation_model.h5`), and other necessary model files.

- **Input Images:** Stored in the `input_images/` directory, containing sample input images (e.g., `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`) for testing the virtual try-on system.

## Usage

1. **Setup:**

   - Ensure Python and necessary libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow) are installed.
   - Download or place the required pre-trained model files in the `pretrained_models/` directory.

2. **Running the System:**

   - Modify and run `main_script.py` to initiate the virtual try-on system.
   - Specify input images or capture images using a webcam for trying on virtual clothing items.
   - Adjust functionalities or add additional features as needed.
